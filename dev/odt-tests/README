This directory contains ODT files that are translated into wrong ODT files
when run through 

apertium -d . en-ca -f odt $ODT_FILE > $OUTPUT_ODT_FILE

(revision 48933)

Errors are probably due to incorrect management of superblanks in structural
transfer.

The files have been produced by galaxyfeeder (Gabriel Esteban) during Google
Code-In 2013

Some files have been removed after DarkGaia has solved some of the problems.
